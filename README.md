## Software stack
To develop this app, it was used the following stack:

- Spring Boot API for back end;
- React Web App for front end.

_The implementation is based on a [Spring Boot, React and AWS course](https://amigoscode.com/courses/enrolled/686693), available at [Amigoscode](https://amigoscode.com/), by [Nelson Djalo](https://twitter.com/amigoscode)._
